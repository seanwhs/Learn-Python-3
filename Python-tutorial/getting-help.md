# Getting help

When you have a problem with Python, you're not alone! There are many
places to ask for help in.

Regardless of where you ask for help, please:
- Don't ask "does someone know ...". Just ask about your problem right away.
- Make your question short.
- Include everything that other people will need to answer your question.
    For example, if you are getting an error, include your code and the error message.


## IRC

IRC is the oldest chatting service I know, but as of 2022, it's still
in use, and a good way to get help in Python.
An advantage with IRC is that you don't need to create an account to use it.

To get started, go to https://web.libera.chat/ and type `##learnpython` or `#python` for the channel name.

- `##learnpython` is a channel where I am regularly, but there's usually only about 20 people there,
    so it could be that nobody answers your question, depending on what time it is.
    I'm on `##learnpython` at about 7PM to 10PM UTC.
    If you see `Akuli` in the user list, that's me :)
- `#python` is an active channel that I don't use much, but someone will likely answer your question pretty quickly.

If you want to post more than 3 lines of code,
put it to [dpaste.com](https://dpaste.com/) first.
Just copy-paste your code to the big text area and click the "Paste it"
button, and then post a link to your paste on IRC.
Otherwise every line of your code will appear as a separate message on IRC,
so if your code is 15 lines, just pasting it in will produce 15 different messages.
This would be annoying.


## Discord

If you have a discord account, you can click the "Explore Public Servers" button at bottom left.

You can then search for e.g. Python, and you should find many servers to choose from.
I am currently @Akuli on a server called "The Programmer's Hangout".


## Websites to ask help on

Personally, I've never asked a question on any of these sites. Getting
help on IRC is much faster.

- [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is a question/answer site
    for programmers. Search for your question first, maybe someone has
    already asked that and it has been answered.
- [The learnpython subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/)
    is another good place to ask Python questions on.
