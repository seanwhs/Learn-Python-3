#Python Course

Version: *1.2*

Original Author: *Charles Severance*

Derivative work by: *John Alexander*

<!-- SUMMARY -->

This is a content (courseware/slideware) for a 32-40 hour Python programming course.

These course slides were originally written by Charles Severance, a professor at the University of Michigan.

This fork (derivative work) of this Python courseware was done with the following goals in mind:

* Provide the highest quality Python courseware possible to help instructors teach Python

* Insure that the slides are properly formatted for use with Microsoft PowerPoint and OpenOffice Impress

* Insure that the slides work seamlessly with open source presentation software (i.e. OpenOffice Impress)

* Make improvements in the original courseware to include:
    * Added several slides on the string formatting operator - "%"
    * Added several slides to teach "how to import Python modules"
    * Added several slides on the "math" module 
    * Added several slides on the range() function. 
    * Heavy review of the courseware code and samples to make sure it is as error free as possible

* Provide maximum flexibility for the improvement of this courseware

I also encourage anyone to fork these slides if they wish, as long as the slides and their changes are also put under the Creative Commons License .  The goal is to provide the best
possible materials to teach computer programming, with Python as an excellent language for students to learn.


##Issues

No known issues.  If someone would like to further test and QA these slides please contact me.  I'd especially be interested
in assistance on testing/using these slides on an Apple Mac computer, and on Linux systems (any distributions).
