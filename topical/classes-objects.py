# Python Classes and Objects

# Python is an object oriented programming language.
# Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.
# A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

# To create a class, use the keyword class:
class MyClass:
    x = 5
